# Connor Mackays Portfolio Website
This is a simple one page portfolio site I created to explain a little about myself and link to some of my portfolio items.

### Tools and Technology Implemented

The site is a one pager created with Google's Materialize framework.  I find it very similar to Bootstrap, which I actually prefer. 
I used Materialize instead, in an attempt to make the site appear different in design than other common portfolio sites.
