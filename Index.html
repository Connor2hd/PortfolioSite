      <h6>Story</h6>
      <p>Ever since introductory classes in high school, I have been hooked on computer science and more specifically computer programming.  I am currently
      attending Niagara College to further my education though I also spend a vast amount of time outside of the classroom learning and developing.</p>
      <p>My current interests are split between ASP.NET web application development and general I.T. infrastructure.  I have been spending a lot of time at home
        testing and setting up various I.T. systems such as Proxmox Virtualization, PfSense, NAS, SAN, and Windows servers.
      <p>I am always looking for new projects to work on and ways to challenge myself.</p>

      Though not the most glamorous job, the grocery store is definitely one of the biggest things that defines who I am today.</p>

       time clocks, and much more.  I worked on a large variety of systems and learned a lot from the rest of the IT team.  I felt like just as I was starting to get the hang of everything, it was time to go back to school.</p>

        <p>The program covered a wide variety of topics which can be seen in great detail using the below link.  The main focus of the program
           I found was ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server technologies.</p>
        <p>The most significant project that I had during my three years at Niagara College was developing a safety inspection web application using ASP.NET that was fully functioning with input from Niagara College staff members.

          <p>The focus of year 2 of my 3 year course at Niagara College was .NET and its surrounding technologies.  I spent a vast amount of my time in school that
          year reviewing ASP.Net MVC and Webforms.  For my year end project I was tasked with creating a safety inspection form creator and management web
          application.  Using ASP.NET webforms and Azure I created a product for the Niagara College Media, Trades, and, Technology safety administration.
          Using this suite of Microsoft tools was one of the most enjoyable projects I have completed thus far.<br><br><p class="bottomleft">The Demo link goes to the application itself, hosted in Azure.

          <p>Following the completion of my ASP.NET web application I wanted to create a website that ran database interactions on more traditional PHP.
          The idea for the website came from other websites such as Yelp, where products can be reviewed.  I have always been amused that I can find 10 reliable
          reviews for the local pizza chain, but none for a college I am paying ~$4000/year for.  So I created my website, CollegeReviews.ca to fill this niche
          but potentially prosperous market.  The coding behind the website is fairly straight forward, it is designed with Bootstrap and has a couple Javascript
          functions included.<br><br><p class="bottomleft">The Demo link goes to the website, CollegeReviews.ca.  The Github link goes to the Git repository where the code can be reviewed.</p></p>

          <p>After using several outdated, clunky, and bland support ticket systems during my career in IT I decided to have a go at creating my own.
          This is still a work in progress but I have the general feel of the application built out.  It is an ASP.NET web application that uses
          styling from Google's Materialize CSS.  I was aiming for a more modern aesthetic with a minimalist look.  I wanted the tickets and their urgency
          to be identifiable at a glance.<br><br><p class="bottomleft">The Demo link goes to the web application hosted on Azure.  The Github link is a link to the Git repository where the code and more information can be viewed.</p></p>

          <p>GoliathHosting.com is definitely my most successful personal project.  During my final year of high school in 2013, a friend and I
            out with the goal of selling web, game, and server hosting to cover our own server rental fees.  The business became much
            more successful that we ever anticipated having more than 150 active clients at it's peak.<br><br>
            While at GoliathHosting I was regularly involved in the purchasing and deployment of server equipment.  I also performed many initial setup
            and configurations of client servers.  I created script for automatically generating game and VOIP servers when a purchase was processed through
            our billing panel, WHMCS.  I worked on the front lines managing customer service and support via Email, live chat, support tickets, and phone.
            Being half of the work force for the company I picked up too many skills to list during the initial setup, development, and success of the small business.
            GoliathHosting as a project has truly been my greatest learning experience in the world of computer science.</p>
