                <h6>Story</h6>
                <p>
                    Ever since introductory classes in high school, I have been hooked on computer science and more specifically computer programming.
                    I continued this interest by enrolling in Niagara Colleges 3 year Computer Programmer Analyst program which I graduated from in 2018.
                    I am currently employed full time as an Application Developer at Western I.T. Group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current interests are split between ASP.NET web application development and general I.T. infrastructure.  I have been spending a lot of time at home
                    testing and setting up various I.T. systems such as Proxmox Virtualization, PfSense, NAS, SAN, and Windows servers.  Since I spend so much time programming during the day
                    I tend to prefer learning different things at home that may not be strictly related to just programming.
                <p>I am always looking for new projects to work on and ways to challenge myself.</p>

                                My main focus during my second year of college was C# in both ASP.NET Webforms and MVC web applications.
                                I have also worked on several projects with Entity Framework 6 and LINQ.
                                At my current position I work mainly with Webforms but continue to work with MVC and Core on personal projects.

                                I have setup a personal home lab for testing and running services in my apartment.  The setup consists of a small server
                                rack with various servers, switches, and other networking equipment.  This setup has allowed me to learn to use various hypervisors, firewalls, and other enterprise resources.
                                This website among others is also hosted on my home server setup.

                                mostly with the PC Technician team working on solutions for computer and technical requirements within the business.  I performed troubleshooting, setup and repair of desktops, laptops, printers, POS systems,
                                time clocks, and much more.  I worked on a large variety of systems and learned a lot from the rest of the I.T. team.

                            The focus of year 2 of my 3 year course at Niagara College was .NET and its surrounding technologies.  I spent a vast amount of my time in school that
                            year reviewing ASP.Net MVC and Webforms.  For my year end project I was tasked with creating a safety inspection form creator and management web
                            application.  Using ASP.NET webforms and Azure I created a product for the Niagara College Media, Trades, and, Technology safety administration.
                            Using this suite of Microsoft tools was one of the most enjoyable projects I have completed thus far.<br><br>

                            Looking over the code now after working with ASP.Net for 18 months I notice a lot of inefficiencies, and things I could have done a lot better.

                            Following the completion of my ASP.NET web application I wanted to create a website that ran database interactions on more traditional PHP.
                            The idea for the website came from other websites such as Yelp, where products can be reviewed.  I have always been amused that I can find 10 reliable
                            reviews for the local pizza chain, but none for a college I am paying ~$4000/year for.  So I created my website, CollegeReviews.ca to fill this niche
                            but potentially prosperous market.  The coding behind the website is fairly straight forward, it is designed with Bootstrap and has a couple Javascript
                            functions included.<br><br>
                        <p class="bottomleft">The Demo link goes to the website, CollegeReviews.ca.  The Github link goes to the Git repository where the code can be reviewed.</p></p>

                            My most recent project is another ASP.Net Webforms control panel.  Looking over my previous work from college I wanted a more polished project to showcase my ASP.Net skills to potential employers.
                            The site is built using an open source Bootstrap theme found here.  The idea was to create a control panel that garage owners could use to manage vehicles, invoices, and clients.
                            I am still working on this at the momment, but hopefully by the time this site is live, I will have it complete.<br><br>
                        <p class="bottomleft">For the demo the sample admin username is Admin@Garage.ca.  The sample client login is Client@Garage.ca.  The password for both is 'testing'.</p></p>

                            GoliathHosting.com is definitely my most successful personal project.  During my final year of high school in 2013, a friend and I
                            out with the goal of selling web, game, and server hosting to cover our own server rental fees.  The business became much
                            more successful that we ever anticipated having more than 150 active clients at it's peak.<br><br>
                            While at GoliathHosting I was regularly involved in the purchasing and deployment of server equipment.  I also performed many initial setup
                            and configurations of client servers.  I created script for automatically generating game and VOIP servers when a purchase was processed through
                            our billing panel, WHMCS.  I worked on the front lines managing customer service and support via Email, live chat, support tickets, and phone.
                            Being half of the work force for the company I picked up too many skills to list during the initial setup, development, and success of the small business.
                            GoliathHosting as a project has truly been my greatest learning experience in the world of computer science.
